[Markdown taskfile help]

The definition of a task is written in the following code block.
Scripts in a code block act as a series of multi-line ShellScript.

| ```task:<group>:<task>  <description>
|
| # Write your script...
|
| ```

The letters that can be used in <group> and <task> are as follows.
- Lower Alphabets, Upper Alphabets, Numbers, '_', '-' and '.'
- First letter is only Lower Alphabets, Upper Alphabets and '_'

<group> and <description> can be empty. (ex: ```task::<task> ~)
'_' group is as same as empty.
Group that first is '_' and the length is over 2 is a private group. \nPrivate groups cannot run from command directly.


* Embedded Comments
Some comments written as '#xxxx> comment' have a special behavior.

  #embed>  <group>:<task>         : The specified task is directly embedded.
  #task>   <group>:<task> -- args : The specified task is embedded as a subshell.
  #task> @ <group>:<task> -- args : The config once flag is temporarily reset.
                                    The rest is the same as without @.
  #config> once                   : When called multiple times, it is called only the first time.
  #args>   comments               : Show comments as arguments in task help.


* Filename
mdtk uses Taskfile.md in the current directory unless you specify a file path with --file/-f flag.
Instead of Taskfile.md, you can use *.taskrun.md.
In this case, however, only one *.taskrun.md file should be placed in the same directory.
Search Order: --file path -> Taskfile.md -> *.taskrun.md


* Sub Taskfile
You can load sub taskfile in the following code block.
There must be no duplicate group/task combinations throughout all loaded files.

| ```taskfile
|
| # Write sub taskfile path...
|
| ```


* Task Cache
You can make a taskdata cache by specifying --make-cache option.
The cache 'may' speed up task reading.
If the cache already exists, it will be read automatically with no option.
However, note that if taskfiles have some updates at this time, the cache will be remake, 
 which is slower than if there was no cache.
Good to use for taskfiles that are being updated less frequently.
To disable the cache, simply delete the relevant cache.
