[Markdown taskfile help]

The definition of a task is written in the following code block.
Scripts in a code block act as a series of multi-line ShellScript.

| ```task:<group>:<task>  <description>
|
| # Write your script...
|
| ```

The letters that can be used in <group> and <task> are as follows.
- Lower Alphabets, Upper Alphabets, Numbers, '_', '-' and '.'
- First letter is only Lower Alphabets, Upper Alphabets and '_'

<group> and <description> can be empty. (ex: ```task::<task> ~)
'_' group is as same as empty.
Group that first is '_' and the length is over 2 is a private group. \nPrivate groups cannot run from command directly.


* Embedded Comments
Some comments written as '#xxxx> comment' have a special behavior.

  #embed>  <group>:<task>         : The specified task is directly embedded.
  #task>   <group>:<task> -- args : The specified task is embedded as a subshell.
  #task> @ <group>:<task> -- args : The config once flag is temporarily reset.
                                    The rest is the same as without @.
  #config> once                   : When called multiple times, it is called only the first time.
  #args>   comments               : Show comments as arguments in task help.


* Filename
mdtk uses Taskfile.md in the current directory unless you specify a file path with --file/-f flag.
Instead of Taskfile.md, you can use *.taskrun.md.
In this case, however, only one *.taskrun.md file should be placed in the same directory.
Search Order: --file path -> Taskfile.md -> *.taskrun.md


* Sub Taskfile
You can load sub taskfile in the following code block.
There must be no duplicate group/task combinations throughout all loaded files.

| ```taskfile
|
| # Write sub taskfile path...
|
| ```
