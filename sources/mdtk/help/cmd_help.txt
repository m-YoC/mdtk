mdtk is a markdown task-runner using codeblock.

  command:  mdtk group-task
            mdtk group-task [--options] -- args...

  How to write each command
    group-task -> group task, group:task, task
                    Can write without group.
                    In this case, all groups will be searched.
                    Special group-task names are as follows.
                    - '_' group   : Searchs only empty-name group.
                    - 'help' task : Show task help.
                                    If write group, show only written group's tasks.
                    - empty       : If 'default' task is defined, run it.
                                    Otherwise, run 'help'.
    args       -> arg_name=arg_value
                    Write after 2 hyphens.
                    {$} is a special variable for --script option, 
                    replaced by positional parameter $1...$9.
